Hey! ğŸ˜„ I'm a 16-year-old from Poland ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±, and I'm all about coding. I've tinkered with C#, Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and I'm currently on a journey to master Go and Lua ğŸš€.

You'll usually find me busy creating cool stuff like games, apps, and handy programs that make life easier for both me and others.  Coding is my passion, and I'm always up for a coding adventure.
