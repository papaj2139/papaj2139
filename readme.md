I am a Python and Node.js developer with a passion for programming. I am currently learning Julia.
I absolutely love Discord and enjoy creating bots to enhance the Discord experience for myself and others.
At the age of 14, I am already actively pursuing my programming interests. I am from Poland and proud of my roots.
I am also involved in game development and have created some games using the Unity engine.
I specialized in c++ for like 4 months but lost interest after almost my every project had memory leaks.
i also know alot of html and basics of some other lanuages but i will forget them if i wont write code using them :).

Im working on:
RENDERWARE REWRITEEN
some games
CITYSCAPE
