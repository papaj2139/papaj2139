I am a Python and Node.js developer with a passion for programming. I am currently learning Julia.
I absolutely love Discord and enjoy creating bots to enhance the Discord experience for myself and others.
At the age of 14, I am already actively pursuing my programming interests. I am from Poland and proud of my roots.
I am also involved in game development and have created some games using the Unity engine.
